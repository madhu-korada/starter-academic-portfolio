<!-- Welcome to my website. :) -->

I currently work at [Hi-tech Robotic Systemz](https://www.hitechroboticsystemz.com/) as Research Engineer.

I did my bachelors in Mechatronics from SRM University. I was a Research student at motion analysis laboratory, where I have worked mostly on computer vision techniques.

I worked as an intern for Wabco technology centre in summer 2018, where we worked on optimizing the vehicle and pedestrian detection algorithms.
